# Projects, problem sets, and assignments from my intermediate macro class

NOTE: None of these projects were intended to involve actual programming and were supposed to be done in excel. I just intentionally replicated everything in a mix of R and Python so I could learn R/Python better. As this was much more of a first learning experience, this is from when I was _very_ inexperienced and please take any bad code with grain of salt. I had only lightly used python before this class, and had never in my life used R before. Also did a lot of LaTeX graphics and
equations, as most of the non-graph related assignments were intended to be done by hand (I wanted to show off). 

## Assignments: 

1. Graphed and wrote up some inflation figures in python

2. Graphed T-bill and GDP forecasting data in python, also includes writeup

3. This was first 'data project'. had to answer a bunch of data related questions about GDP data by looking into the details of the data. All done in R/R markdown. 

4. Problem set. I don't have the original problems but I copied all the written ones in the PDF. All done in R markdown. Includes a bunch of custom LaTeX graphics (not part of the assignment, I was just showing off lol)

5. Similar story to assignment 4. Another, different problem set. Answered a bunch of theoretical macro questions and made a bunch of latex graphics. All in R markdown
